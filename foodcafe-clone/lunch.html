              You need to eat lunch, but sometimes, the prospect of coming up
              with a creative, healthy idea for homemade lunch is less appealing
              So you take the easy way out by grabbing something quick around
              the coner 'often at the expense of your wallet or your waistline.
              Instead of struggling, try some of this healthy lunch ideas to
              refresh your meals.

            <li><b>Nut Butter, Banana, and Chia Seed Toast</b></li>
            <p>
              Try this superfood twist on classic PB and toast with 1/2 a banana
              (sliced) and a sprinkle of chia, which is packed with vitamins and
              minerals (like six times more calcium than milk!).
            </p>
            <li><b>Berry and Yogurt Smoothie</b></li>
            <p>
              Here’s a simple and delicious smoothie for the morning rush. Blend
              frozen fruit (banana and berries work well) with Greek yogurt and
              a liquid of your choice (milk, juice, coconut water—whatever you
              like). Freeze overnight and thaw throughout the day to enjoy in
              the afternoon or blend up in the morning.
            </p>
            <li><b>Savory Oatmeal With an Egg</b></li>
            <p>
              Take oatmeal to a whole new level by making it savory. Prepare as
              usual with milk or water, but add a pinch of salt and pepper
              instead of any cinnamon or sugar. Then top with an over-easy or
              poached egg and sprinkle on a little cheese for an extra tasty
              kick.
            </p>

            <li><b>Quinoa Fruit Salad</b></li>
            <p>
              Spice up a plain old fruit cup with a scoop of quinoa. Toss the
              whole shebang around until the quinoa is evenly distributed. Add a
              dressing of honey, lime, and basil for a little extra body.
            </p>
            <li><b>Tomato Toast With Macadamia Ricotta</b></li>
            <p>
              Here’s a healthier take on a classic breakfast sandwich: Take 2
              slices of a hearty whole-grain bread, spread each slice with 1
              tablespoon of homemade macadamia ricotta cheese, and sprinkle with
              shiso or basil, kosher salt, and fresh cracked pepper to taste.
              Add 1-2 hearty slices of fresh heirloom tomatoes (blotted with
              paper towel to remove excess liquid) and enjoy.
            </p>
            <li><b>Quinoa and Chia Porridge</b></li>
            <p>
              Cooking quinoa in milk (cow, soy, or almond) and adding some sweet
              spices and fruit makes for a great substitute for classic hot
              breakfast cereals. Plus, it’s high in protein and essential amino
              acids like lysine, which is essential for tissue growth and
              repair. Simply put all the ingredients into a pot and bring to a
              boil. Then simmer, stir, top with your favorite add-ons, and
              enjoy!
            </p>
            <li><b>Avocado Toast With Egg</b></li>
            <p>
              Sometimes simple is just better. Top two lightly toasted slices of
              whole-grain bread with smashed avocado and a sprinkling of salt
              and pepper. Layer on two sunny-side up eggs for a healthy dose of
              protein, and you've got a well-rounded breakfast. Stack 'em in a
              tupperware container for easy transport or cook the yolks a bit
              more and make the whole thing into a sandwich.
            </p>
            <li><b>Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl</b></li>
            <p>
              Here’s a healthy way to have chocolate for breakfast. A bowlful of
              quinoa makes for a filling, protein-rich base, and the banana and
              berries add a few servings of fruit.
            </p>
            <li><b>Overnight Crock-Pot Egg Casserole</b></li>
            <p>
              Wake up to a house smelling like sausage and effortlessly put
              breakfast on your plate, all thanks to the beauty of a slow
              cooker. Layer the vegetables, sausage, and cheese in the
              Crock-Pot, then top with a mix of eggs and cream (you'd be fine
              using regular or nondairy milk too for a lighter option), and
              you're just one sleep away from a delicious meal.
            </p>
            <li><b>Warm Fruit Bowl</b></li>
            <p>
              Craving dessert for breakfast? Or breakfast for dessert? This
              gluten-free bowl should hit the spot. Simply bake a berry blend in
              the oven, sprinkle with dark chocolate shavings, and add a cup of
              milk.
            </p>
            <li><b>Zucchini Bread Oatmeal</b></li>
            <p>
              Turn a classic baked loaf into oatmeal with this recipe. Adding
              shredded zucchini is a great way to fit in an extra serving of
              veggies. Throw on a handful of toasted walnuts for some added
              crunch.
            </p>
            <li><b>Egg Breakfast Muffins</b></li>
            <p>
              Finally, a muffin without allllll the sugar. These guys are simple
              to make ahead of time, and last all week. Blend or whisk eggs with
              spinach, bacon, and cheese, then pour the mixture into muffin
              tins. Bake for 15-20 minutes before serving or storing in the
              refrigerator for later.
            </p>
            <li><b>Open-Face Breakfast Sandwich</b></li>
            <p>
              Who doesn’t love an egg sandwich? Simply toss arugula with olive
              oil and lemon juice before frying eggs with a dash of salt and
              pepper. Place on top of whole-wheat toast layered with ricotta and
              a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Wrap in foil and enjoy
              whenever the craving hits!
            </p>

            <li><b> Peanut Butter and Banana Smoothie</b></li>
            <p>
              Smoothies are a perfect on-the-go snack any time of day. Blend
              frozen bananas, peanut butter, soy milk, Greek yogurt, honey, and
              a few ice cubes. If this is a morning snack, keep it in a
              tight-sealing container and throw it in a gym or work bag. For an
              afternoon boost, prep it the night before and freeze. Remove in
              the morning, and it will be thawed and ready to enjoy after lunch.
              Tip: Add a scoop of your favorite chocolate or vanilla protein for
              an extra protein boost.
            </p>
            <li><b>PB and J Waffle Sandwich</b></li>
            <p>
              Try this sweet take on a classic breakfast sandwich the next time
              you're eating on the go. Prepare a whole-grain toaster waffle and
              slice in half. Spread with 2 tablespoons nut butter and jelly of
              your choice, and layer sliced strawberries on top.
            </p>
            <li><b>Sweet Potato and Black Bean Breakfast Burrito</b></li>
            <p>
              Breakfast burritos are a great, easy snack to keep on hand. Make a
              bunch, wrap in foil, and keep in the freezer for whenever the
              craving hits. Protein from the eggs and black beans keeps you
              fuller longer, and the sweet potato keeps things interesting.
            </p>
            <li><b>Chocolate Peanut Butter Granola Apple Bites</b></li>
            <p>
              This is a perfect pick for apple season. Cut your favorite kind of
              apple into wedges and scoop nut butter onto each slice. Sprinkle
              with oats or granola and cinnamon, and drizzle a bit of melted
              chocolate on top. Wrap up the apple slices in foil or plastic wrap
              to save for later or enjoy as is.
            </p>

            <li><b>Chocolate Pumpkin Oatmeal</b></li>
            <p>
              A heaping dollop of pumpkin puree is a great way to squeeze in an
              extra dose of veggies. Plus, the super-orange superfood is packed
              with nutrients and a healthy dose of fiber. This recipe pairs the
              pumpkin with oats, chia seeds, cocoa, and almond milk for a quick
              and easy breakfast.
            </p>
            <li><b> Blueberry Almond Overnight Oats</b></li>
            <p>
              This is the ultimate busy-bee breakfast. Combine oats, chia seeds,
              blueberries, vanilla, almond milk, and maple syrup in a sealed
              container the night before. In the morning, top with slivered
              almonds and half a sliced banana, and you're ready for breakfast.
              If you're in the mood for something warm, heat in the microwave
              for 1-2 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><b>Coconut Yogurt Quinoa Muffins</b></li>
            <p>
              By this point, it's probably obvious we think quinoa makes
              anything better. So when it comes to muffins? It’s a no-brainer.
              Try these little bites for breakfast or an after-lunch treat.
