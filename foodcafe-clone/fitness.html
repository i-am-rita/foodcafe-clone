          <ol>
            <li><b>Beet juice for stamina</b></li>
            <p>
              Recent research shows that this ruby red root veggie may be more
              effective at boosting energy than caffeine, or nearly anything
              you'll find in the supplement aisle. When UK researchers asked
              male athletes to down either 16 ounces of organic beetroot juice
              or a placebo, those who gulped the real thing cycled for up to 16%
              longer, an effect scientists say isn't achievable by any other
              known means, including training. To bolster your performance,
              invest in a juicer and grab some fresh beets, which are in season
              year-round. Or look for bottled beet juice, which can be sipped
              straight or blended into a pre-workout smoothie.
            </p>

            <li><b>Honey for endurance</b></li>
            <p>
              Research conducted at the University of Memphis Exercise and Sport
              Nutrition Laboratory found that consuming honey before exercise
              provides "time-released" fuel to give athletes steady blood sugar
              and insulin levels over a longer duration. This natural sweetener
              also boosted power, speed, and endurance in competitive cyclists
              who downed it prior to and at 10-mile intervals throughout a
              40-mile race. For quality and purity, I recommend USDA Certified
              Organic raw honey. Enjoy it straight off a spoon, or mix it into a
              pre-workout snack like oatmeal.
            </p>

            <li><b>Pea protein to delay muscle fatigue</b></li>
            <p>
              Pea protein powder has been generating serious buzz in the sports
              nutrition community for some time now. The reason: it's rich in
              branched chain amino acids, compounds that have been shown to
              delay fatigue during exercise. The arginine in this powder (which
              is made from yellow peas) has also been shown to enhance immunity,
              while the lysine boosts calcium absorption and decreases calcium
              losses to help maintain strong bones. One scoop can pack more than
              25 grams of lean protein, which can be whipped into a smoothie
              along with almond milk, a dollop of almond butter, cinnamon, and
              frozen cherries or berries.
            </p>

            <li><b>Blueberries to reduce inflammation</b></li>
            <p>
              To test the anti-inflammatory and recovery effects of blueberries,
              researchers at Appalachian State University recruited well-trained
              athletes and fed them about 9 ounces of blueberries daily for six
              weeks, plus another 13 ounces an hour before a two-and a-half-hour
              run. The results were impressive. In addition to a reduction in
              inflammation, blueberry eaters experienced a boost in natural
              killer cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a vital role
              in immunity. When fresh blueberries aren't practical, reach for
              dried or freeze dried options to stash in your gym bag.
            </p>

            <li><b>Tart cherries to fight pain and regain strength</b></li>
            <p>
              At the University of Vermont's Human Performance Laboratory,
              researchers asked men to drink either 12 ounces of a tart cherry
              juice blend or a placebo twice daily for eight days. On the fourth
              day of the study, the athletes completed a strenuous
              strength-training routine. Two weeks later, the opposite beverage
              was provided, and the training was repeated. Scientists found that
              the cherry juice had a significant effect on pain reduction. In
              addition, strength loss averaged 22% in the placebo group compared
              to just 4% in the cherry group. Fresh tart cherries are only in
              season in late summer, but frozen and dried options are becoming
              easier to find, as is 100% tart cherry juice.
            </p>

            <li><b>Salmon to build muscle</b></li>
            <p>
              The omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish like salmon have been
              linked to a laundry list of benefits, from fighting heart disease
              to staving off type 2 diabetes. But animal research shows it may
              also be a potent muscle booster. Compared to steers fed cottonseed
              and olive oils, those that consumed fish oil showed improved
              muscle development: their bodies used twice the amount of amino
              acids to build new protein tissues, especially skeletal muscles.
              Include wild salmon in meals a few times a week, or try salmon
              jerky as a portable snack. If you can't or don't eat seafood, look
              for an algae-based source of omega-3s.
            </p>

            <li><b>Watermelon to reduce muscle soreness</b></li>
            <p>
              Recently, Spanish sports medicine scientists discovered that
              watermelon juice helped relieve muscle soreness when about 16
              ounces were consumed an hour before exercise. The effect is likely
              due to citrulline, a natural substance found in watermelon that's
              been tied to improved artery function and lowered blood pressure
              (it's even been dubbed "nature’s Viagra"). I'm starting to see
              bottled watermelon juice popping up all over the place. And when
              you eat it fresh, be sure to bite into the white rind a bit—that's
              where citrulline is found in higher concentrations.
            </p>

            <li><b>Pomegranate for muscle strength recovery</b></li>
            <p>
              The antioxidants in pomegranate have been linked to enhanced
              memory and brain activity, and now researchers at the University
              of Texas at Austin report that pomegranate juice helps improve
              muscle recovery. Researchers recruited volunteers who were
              randomly assigned to maintain their normal diets and add 4 ounces
              of either pomegranate juice or a placebo twice a day. Both groups
              performed resistance-training exercises, but those who gulped pom
              experienced significantly less muscle soreness and reduced muscle
              weakness for up to 7 days. Pomegranate is a winter fruit, but you
              can find frozen options year-round. Just thaw and add to oatmeal,
              parfaits, or garden salads. Small shots of 100% juice are also a
              good option.
            </p>

            <li><b>Coffee for next-day energy</b></li>
            <p>
              A recent study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology
              found that glycogen, the body's storage form of carbohydrates, is
              replenished more rapidly when athletes consume both carbs and
              caffeine following exhaustive exercise. Compared to carbs alone,
              the combo resulted in a 66% increase in muscle glycogen 4 hours
              after intense exercise. That's significant because packing more
              fuel into the energy "piggy banks" within your muscles means that
              the next time you train or perform, you’ve upped your ability to
              exercise harder or longer.
            </p>

            <li><b>Watercress to reduce DNA damage</b></li>
            <p>
              A recent study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found
              that watercress, a peppery green from the mustard family,
              effectively countered the "wear and tear" effects of exercise.
              Healthy young men were given about 3 ounces of watercress daily
              for eight weeks, and asked to participate in treadmill workouts
              that included short bursts of intense exercise. Another exercise
              group did the workouts without watercress as a control. The men
              who missed out on watercress experienced more exercise-induced DNA
              damage, and the benefits were seen after just one dose. In other
              words, those who ate the green for the first time just two hours
              before hitting the treadmill experienced the same benefits as
              those who had munched on it daily for two months. Watercress makes
              a wonderful salad base and, like spinach and kale, it can be
              whipped into a smoothie.
            </p>

            <li><b>Dark chocolate to curb exercise-induced stress</b></li>
            <p>
              Numerous studies support the myriad benefits of dark chocolate and
              new research published in the European Journal of Nutrition adds
              exercise protection to the list. In the study, healthy men were
              asked to eat 3.5 ounces of 70% dark chocolate two hours before a
              two-and-a-half-hour bout of cycling. Compared to a control group,
              the chocolate eaters experienced higher blood antioxidant levels
              and reduced markers of exercise-induced cell stress. Enjoy a few
              individually wrapped squares of dark chocolate daily, melt and
              drizzle it over fresh fruit, or mix it into oatmeal, smoothies, or
              parfaits.
            </p>

            <li><b>The Power of Protein</b></li>
            <p>
              Eating properly for strength training means choosing high-quality
              protein sources and eating them at the optimal times. Unlike
              carbohydrates and fat, protein is not a primary energy source, but
              it plays an important role in metabolism and muscle health.
              Carbohydrates, fat, and protein work together to keep the body
              performing at its best. The goal of proper protein intake is to
              consume adequate amounts throughout the day, with extra doses
              after workouts. Eating protein after a strength workout?lifting
              weights or resistance training?helps restore the muscle tissues
              you’ve stressed during that workout. Over time, that combination
              builds strength and lean body mass. Instead of turning to
              supplements, get the majority of your protein from foods?your body
              will benefit from a well-rounded nutrient package of vitamins and
              minerals that come with those foods.
            </p>

            <li><b>Lean Beef</b></li>
            <p>
              Lean beef is an ideal source of protein, and stir-frying is a
              quick and easy cooking method. Healthy carbohydrates from rice,
              and fiber from fresh veggies make for a well rounded meal after a
              strength workout. Consuming 20 to 30 grams post-exercise is
              plenty, and this recipe puts you right in that zone with 24.4
              grams.
            </p>

            <li><b>Eggs and Egg Whites</b></li>
            <p>
              Eggs have it all. They're one of the highest-quality protein
              sources around, because they contain all the necessary amino acid
              building blocks for healthy muscles. Have an omelet for breakfast,
              lunch, or dinner with 100 percent whole-grain toast for a
              satisfying meal that provides about 25 grams of protein and about
              15 percent of your daily fiber needs. If you’re watching your
              dietary cholesterol intakes, you can make it with just egg whites.
            </p>

            <li><b>Protein-Rich Soy</b></li>
            <p>
              Tofu makes a filling and tasty meal! This vegetarian protein
              source is full of heart-healthy fats and, like all veggies, is
              cholesterol-free, yet it still provides your muscles with
              high-quality protein. Pair with veggies to add flavor plus a hefty
              dose of vitamins.
            </p>

            <li><b> Whole Grains with Protein</b></li>
            <p>
              Quinoa (pronounced “KEEN-wah”) is a mild grain with a pleasant
              chewy texture?and it’s higher in protein than most whole grains.
              Cooked in broth, it has even more flavor. Beans add extra protein
              and fiber to make a satisfying vegetarian salad.
            </p>

            <li><b>Legumes</b></li>
            <p>
              Legumes such as lentils, beans, and peas come packed with both
              healthy protein and carbohydrates. Lentils contain metabolism-
              boosting B vitamins as well as magnesium for bone health and iron
              for healthy red blood cells.
            </p>

            <li><b>Skinless Chicken Breasts</b></li>
            <p>
              Skinless chicken breast is one of the leanest sources of protein.
              One 3-ounce serving has 94 calories, 20 grams of protein, and
              about 1 gram of fat. Quesadillas are easy to make with many fresh
              vegetables and some low-fat cheese. Use whole wheat flour
              tortillas to incorporate some additional whole grains.
            </p>

            <li><b>Fish Rich in Omega-3s</b></li>
            <p>
              Seafood is an ideal protein because it’s low in artery-clogging
              saturated fat. Plus, fatty fish rich in omega-3 fats can help
              lower triglyceride levels. There are so many kinds to choose from
              that there’s something to please everyone’s palate. Cod is a
              tender and mild fish and contains about 135 mg of omega-3s per
              3-ounce serving. Cod also contains selenium, a mineral with
              antioxidant powers involved in enzyme function.
